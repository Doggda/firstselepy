#this was created with py 3.8.2 and selenium (dunno which release) during the corona pandemy in april 2020

You might say this wasn't done the way how the github guide recommends things 2 b done. But I'm a simple, somewhat older, IT guy so like ev'ry otha IT guy I refuse to read guides - I simply do it.
